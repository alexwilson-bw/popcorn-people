## Running the app
- `git clone ` the repo
- `npm install`
- Here you may run into a vite error for some reason?  npm install vite if so, that's worked for me.
- `npm run dev`
- after `npm run dev` the application is now running on localhost:5173


## Using the app

Put names in the list `@/stores/names.ts` and they'll become one of the names on the wheel.

Add/Remove names capability is present in the app but new names will not appear there.
